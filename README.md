In this project, I cleaned and explored to find insights and patterns using postgreSQL. 
I gots insights like, the customers that reside in the same address,
the customer that spent the highest money,
the movies that has been rented so far,
the movie that was rented the most,
movie that has not been offered for rent,
the profit made by each store, 
number of movies rented under each ratings,
the actors that acted in more than 20 movies,
number of movies each actors have acted,
name and number of movies under PG
and many other interesting insights.
